**Word Counter**

The Word Counter project aims to develop a Python program that calculates the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. The primary objectives include gaining proficiency in handling user input, manipulating strings, creating modular functions, implementing basic control flow, and displaying output.The program prompts the user to input a sentence or paragraph, then employs string manipulation techniques to count the number of words. It utilizes a function to perform the word counting logic, ensuring modularity and code organization. Basic control flow structures are employed to handle various input scenarios, such as empty input or whitespace-only input. Finally, the program displays the word count as the output.

**Features of the Word Counter project:**

***User Input:** The program prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph via the command line.

***String Manipulation:** It utilizes string manipulation techniques to process the user-provided text, such as splitting the input into individual words.

***Word Counting Logic:** The program implements a function specifically dedicated to counting the number of words in the input text.

***Function Creation:** Modular code is emphasized through the creation of functions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

***Basic Control Flow:** Basic control flow structures (e.g., conditional statements) are used to handle different scenarios, such as empty input or input containing only whitespace.

***Output Display:** The word count is displayed as the output of the program, providing the user with immediate feedback on the number of words in their input.
